# Coffee-Site

Welcome to RPSLS, here you can play the game Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock. The rules are simple, just like Rock paper scissors but with lizards and Spock.

"Scissors cuts Paper
Paper covers Rock
Rock crushes Lizard
Lizard poisons Spock
Spock smashes Scissors
Scissors decapitates Lizard
Lizard eats Paper
Paper disproves Spock
Spock vaporizes Rock
(and as it always has) Rock crushes Scissors"
